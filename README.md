# Overview

Using the ```mtcars``` data set, we answer the following two questions:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

A two-sided t-test concludes that manual transmission is better for MPG. And a multivariate linear regression concludes that manual transmission accounts for a roughly 3 MPG difference over automatic transmission.
